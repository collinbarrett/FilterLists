    "description": "I use an ad blocker not because I hate ads, but because it makes the Internet so much more safe and less annoying. Most advertising is horrible and annoying, but there are exceptions. However, ad blocking lists like EasyList are dedicated to blocking all ads. The only maintained \"Acceptable Ads\" list is by Eyeo, Inc., which basically takes bribes to whitelist ads. I wanted to start an Acceptable Ads list that was of the people, by the people and for the people.",

So until the AdGuard Home team implements a better way to deal with $ values, here's my intermissional list to work around it.",

Although it's impossible to block thousands of these plugins without breaking too many sites, blocking those unwanted plugins won't be a bad idea. While popular social and annoyances filters block many of them, they come with tons of unnecessary rules[^1] and also occasionally cause false-positive. For these reasons I've settled down to AdGuard Social media filter which is relatively small in size and rarely breaks pages; however, it only blocks minimal set of the plugins. This list includes 1) rules for the plugins not on the Social media filter or other default filter lists, 2) rules almost equivalent to Noscript's Application Boundaries Enforcer, and 3) a regex rule focused only on the latest survey scam campaign.",
