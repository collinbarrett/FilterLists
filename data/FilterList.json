These IP addresses are usually servers rented by cybercriminals directly and used for the exclusive purpose of hosting a Feodo C&C server. Hence you should expect no legit traffic to those IP addresses. I highly recommend you to block/drop any traffic towards any Feodo C&C using the Feodo BadIP Blocklist. Please consider that this blocklist only contains IP addresses used by version B of the Feodo Trojan. C&C communication channels used by version A, version C and version D are not covered by this blocklist.",

    "description": "Here's how this list works. This is a categorised list of URLs that clot up Google search results. The list is designed for use with Google Hit Hider by Domain (and its Import function) for Google Search and Google Chrome users, in such a way that it removes search results for the URLs from your Google searches. If any other URL-based search-result-blockers for other search engines (incl. for Google Image Search) and browsers exist out there, feel free to tell me about them. The list is VERY subjective, so quite a few of you may NOT want to block the results for ALL of these URLs. In that case, simply pick whichever ones from this buffet that you want to block, and paste them into Google Hit Hider by Domain. While this list is technically possible to add to adblocker tools, it'd be a very bad idea to do so, since you wouldn't have any control over which URLs you'll be able to block outright or not.",

However, their displaying does temporarily break some elements on some sites... and can even break them outright if using certain adblock lists that prevent cookie notifications. The problem is believed to be even more frequent in non-EU EEC countries like Norway. So if you find yourself frustrated by the breakage, this list is for you.",

So now I've made a higher-contrast theme that should make that job a lot easier for me. It just so happened that pink was the least straining non-grey background colour on my eyes by far, but I don't mind that.",
