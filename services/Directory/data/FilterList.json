    "description": "WordPress plugins have been security nightmare and are usually implemented in first-party resource that bypasses medium mode. Although it's impossible to block thousands of these plugins without breaking too many sites, blocking those unwanted plugins won't be a bad idea. While popular social and annoyances filters block many of them, they come with tons of unnecessary rules[^1] and also occasionally cause false-positive. For these reasons I've settled down to AdGuard Social media filter which is relatively small in size and rarely breaks pages; however, it only blocks minimal set of the plugins. This list includes 1) rules for the plugins not on the Social media filter or other default filter lists, 2) rules almost equivalent to Noscript's Application Boundaries Enforcer, and 3) a regex rule focused only on the latest survey scam campaign.",
