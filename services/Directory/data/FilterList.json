For these reasons I've settled down to AdGuard Social media filter which is relatively small in size and rarely breaks pages; however, it only blocks minimal set of the plugins. This list includes 1) rules for the plugins not on the Social media filter or other default filter lists, 2) rules almost equivalent to Noscript's Application Boundaries Enforcer, and 3) a regex rule focused only on the latest survey scam campaign.",
