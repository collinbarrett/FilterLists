## Adding or Updating Lists

To submit a new list or update data about an existing list, please submit a pull request to [data](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/tree/master/data) in conjunction with the data model described [here](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/wiki/Data-Model_sidebar). Alternatively, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/issues/new) providing information for all of the fields described in the [data model](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/wiki/Data-Model_sidebar).

Note that filterlists that are maintained by CHEF-KOCH will not be added, due to him on at least 3 occasions breaking licence terms while refusing to honor requests to accomodate to them, rude behavior towards other filterlist makers, and having tried to get FilterLists.com shut down on thin grounds. Partial details about this can be found [here](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2019/03/2019-03-05-WindowsSpyBlocker.md).
