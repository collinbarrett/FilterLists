FilterLists is the independent, comprehensive directory of filter and host lists for advertisements, trackers, malware, and annoyances.

# Background

FilterLists helps to protect your privacy and security when using the internet. It provides a comprehensive directory of subscription lists to block advertisements, malware, trackers, and other general annoyances. First, install one of the [software tools](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/blob/master/data/Software.json) that supports these lists. Then, you can subscribe to a set of these lists inside of that software. If you need help or have a comment/question, open an [Issue](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/issues).

Using a software firewall or adblocker has become a key tool in protecting one's privacy online. While the current business model of the "free" internet relies upon advertising revenue, publishers have become too flippant about tracking users without their consent. Advertising networks track users' browsing habits around the internet building lucrative profiles to exploit for targeted marketing or big data research. Until internet publishers develop more transparency or a new business model, we must continue to take the protection of our privacy into our hands.

Typical adblockers run as an extension in popular web browsers. As we browse the internet, they compare HTTP requests to their list of hosts and filters to selectively block advertisements, trackers, and malware. This filtering helps to protect the surfer's privacy, prevents [malvertising attacks](http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/11/malvertising-is-cybercriminals-latest-sweet-spot/ "Why Malvertising Is Cybercriminals' Latest Sweet Spot - Wired"), and [reduces bandwidth requirements](http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/08/blocking-ads-can-cut-network-traffic-25-to-40-study-shows/ "Blocking Ads Can Cut Network Traffic 25% to 40%, Study Shows - VentureBeat"). Thousands of contributors work hard to maintain these FilterLists for anyone to use. Locating and selecting these lists, however, has not historically been very easy. This project aims to solve that problem.

# Contributing

## Adding or Updating Lists

To submit a new list or update data about an existing list, please submit a pull request to [data](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/tree/master/data) in conjunction with the data model described [here](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/wiki/Data-Model_sidebar). Alternatively, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/issues/new) providing information for all of the fields described in the [data model](https://github.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/wiki/Data-Model_sidebar).

## Adding or Updating Rules

FilterLists does not maintain any of these lists. It serves only as a discovery tool to direct users to lists that they may want to use. If you want to request addition, modification, or removal of a rule from a list, you will need to contact the maintainers of that list directly. FilterLists provides a variety of ways you can get in contact with the maintainers to do so.

## Building and Running Locally

We have containerized FilterLists to make it as easy as possible for contributers to get the project up and running locally.

### Up and Running

1. Install Docker CE for your computer's operating system. [Docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
2. Clone the FilterLists git repository to your computer. [Docs](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)
3. Navigate to the root directory of your locally cloned FilterLists git repository in a command-line interface.
4. Execute `docker-compose up -d`.
5. Visit the locally running version of FilterLists in a web browser at `http://localhost/`.

### Testing changes to the data (.json files)

#### Automated

Execute:

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.data.tests.yml down -v && docker-compose -f docker-compose.data.tests.yml build api && docker-compose -f docker-compose.data.tests.yml run api`

#### Manual

1. Execute `docker container ls` to find the `CONTAINER ID` of the `filterlists.api` container.
2. Execute `docker-compose up -d --build [CONTAINER ID]` replacing `[CONTAINER ID]` with the hash from step 1.
3. Verify your changes are properly reflected at `http://localhost/`.

### Testing changes to the `Api`, `Services`, or `Data` projects

#### Automated

- For `Services`, execute:

  `docker-compose -f docker-compose.services.tests.yml build api && docker-compose -f docker-compose.services.tests.yml run --rm api`

- For `Data`, execute:

  `docker-compose -f docker-compose.data.tests.yml down -v && docker-compose -f docker-compose.data.tests.yml build api && docker-compose -f docker-compose.data.tests.yml run api`

#### Manual

1. Execute `docker container ls` to find the `CONTAINER ID` of the `filterlists.api` container.
2. Execute `docker-compose up -d --build [CONTAINER ID]` replacing `[CONTAINER ID]` with the hash from step 1.
3. Verify your changes are properly reflected at `http://localhost/api`.

### Testing changes to the `Web` project

1. Execute `docker container ls` to find the `CONTAINER ID` of the `filterlists.web` container.
2. Execute `docker-compose up -d --build [CONTAINER ID]` replacing `[CONTAINER ID]` with the hash from step 1.

### Debugging

1. Execute `docker container ls -a` to find the `CONTAINER ID` of the container in question.
2. Execute `docker logs [CONTAINER ID]` replacing `[CONTAINER ID]` with the hash from step 1 to view the logs from that container.

## Internet Explorer TPL users

The FilterLists.com website returns a blank page in Internet Explorer, mostly due to problems with both polyfill and JavaScript elements, in addition to IE being considered by us to be an outdated browser. To help alleviate this, a makeshift archive has been set up. To view a smaller TPL-only archive with subscribable links, right-click on [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collinbarrett/FilterLists/master/data/TPLSubscriptionAssistant.html), choose to save it as an HTML file, and open it in Internet Explorer â‰¥9.
